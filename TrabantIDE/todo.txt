+Prototype: Descent
+Resize window every time a prototype is started/stopped.
+Show output log every time a prototype is started.
+Make toolbar disabled by default.
+Prototype: Quake
+Fix explosion look in Quake - looks extremely poor since the strength/size is small and gravity is to heavy on smoke and fire, etc.
+Idling push engine (sound). Currently only combustion and the like idles. descent.py
+Fix collision sounds in Quake - hard hit when moving forward but not when falling straight down. Too hard hits in general. Grenades whack the floor.
