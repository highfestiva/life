Kill Cutie

Bombulum - use the pendulum to push bombs off their respective "poles" befor they blow up. Gravity is from the center in all directions. "Poles" are elevators that rise "up" towards the center.

Car Jumpin'

Helicopter Gravity Force 3D - steer using accelerometer, add a "calibrate" button somewhere. Cam behind or behind on one side.

Robo Arm - optimize a movement scheme to make the robot pick something up and move it to a designated area. Definition of done = object colliding with trigger and object velocity <= threshold.

Ping pong racket. Try to bounce the ball on the racket without dropping it on the floor.

Space ship flight. Fly though predefined map, steer using swipe left/right/up/down? Or accelerometer? Fly close to ground, to give impression of moving VERY fast.

Spider Tank. Two thumbs steering.

MMO space flight. Ships parks in "bee hives", LoD the whole world. Fly, shoot. Guild vs. guild.

Single player vehicle simulation puzzle. Sorta like light-Bot, but in more dimentsions and with vehicles. The steering is a chart with different input (at interval times) and a slider next to each which determins "how much". Also add a road sign selector at the top of the chart (iPhone-like slider left/right?) where you can pick your vechile. Start/stop button. Done!

Playing a Matrix-style octopus! Flying quickly, swirling arms, landing hard, climbing and flying away again.

Playing a presentation. Don't know how or why, but I'm on to something.
