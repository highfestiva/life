+Slime Volleyball

+Kill Cutie

-Bombulum - use the pendulum to push bombs off their respective "poles" befor they blow up. Gravity is from the center in all directions. "Poles" are elevators that rise "up" towards the center. "Gravity" is directly affected by the accelerometer.

-Ping pong racket. Try to bounce the ball on the racket without dropping it on the floor.

+Downwash, i.e. Helicopter Gravity Force 2D/3D - steer using accelerometer, add a "calibrate" button somewhere. Cam behind or behind on one side.

Knobbelen

Cowboy bank shooter. In comes a robber or a citizen, shoot by tapping - fast! Reload by tapping some button near the bottom of the screen.

Crazy hoArse - mad, galloping horse using rigging+skinning. Spinning eyes, flailing limbs, strange obstacles. Make it look EXTREMELY organic!

Puzzle game! YEAH! The big one!

Kill the Commies! Use your stationed grenade launcher to take out all the red cars driving in and out of town. Have fun with physics! This could really rock!!! All buildings, the land and the other commuters are beige. They all travel on highways in and out of the city. Bridges, too. You can monitor 1, 2 or 3 roads on different levels. Avoid killing Americans. Different ammo, nuke for instance. Air strike?

Pick up toys using a "Liseberg crane".

Cyber Sled re-make. Buy hull, engine, primary and secondary weapons. Single player, one on one. And perhaps network?

Hold off attacking robots. Either using cranes (Loke's idea, one for stomping, one for piercing, one for shooting, etc.) or using contraptions. A bit like Plants vs. Zombies?

Clone of Bloons, but in 3D?

Something very physical - stack boxes? Get all the balls in the hole? Keep the balls from falling into the hole?

Something highly unphysical. Draw stuff fast? Circle the right symbol fast? Mimic the swipe-pattern?

Avoid the attackers (robots, tanks, something else?). You control the avatar by instant swipes, so the game is very fast!

UFO Strike - Be a flying saucer and take out Earth's defenses. UFO flies automatically. Tap to shoot houses, sky scrapers, tanks, planes, canons, and pick up boosts by tapping. Program: generate terrain, cities with destructable blocks! Going to be awesome!

WW2 tank vs. tank, similar to the Cyber Sled remake.

Multiplayer tank game in Gbg, generated through Google maps/street view.

Fleeing animal made up by particles and can shape-shift. Tiger to run across trees, cliffs; horse to run across plains and mountains; bird to span gaps. Run during night. Full moon. A bit like a DEMO!

Sniper game. Shoot people off the sky scrapers?

Agent game, a bit like Amiga's Impossible Mission, but darker and using guns and a suit.

Dinosaur game!

Int. Karate+ remake. Or Tekken.

Modern clone of Bards Tail!

Sandbox: place things in the world, make them go.

 - Free play mode.
 - Place stones, cars, hovercraft, houses.
 - Activate engines at certain times.
 - Place travel route for vehicle.
 - Perhaps it should be: play as an alien, using a flying saucer?
 - Map-like controls: pinch zoom, move stuff, rotate stuff.
 - Play, pause, stop functionality. Can play, pause, change some, play some more.
 - Possible to interact during play.
 - (Multi player?)
 - Save/upload maps.
 - Download maps.
 - WOW!

Make your contraption move the longest/fastest. Build and race, timelapsed multiplayer.

Create your own game, share with friends. Construct basic physics, add looks and simple rules.

Ball-into-hole using basic building blocks. Programming (x,y,z, rotation)? Placement? Time contraint? Score higher on lower time? Fewer programming lines? How to separate it from the 2D ballgame I played before? Many balls? Flowing through the start point? YEAH!

Flocking game. School of fish? Birds? Something! The prototype should be fun without trying, so everything else should be a bonus.

Scare-crow Soccer / Soccer for Dummies - a rag-doll, you, is the goal-keeper; the computer does the shooting.

UFO Counter - Saucers come and land, and ET's emegerge. Take 'em out before they blow up planet Earth!

Crazy game using genitals as obstacles.

Sliding racing game. Hovercraft? Bob sleigh? Something of the kind...

Fork lift puzzle game - move all the boxes to the right locations.

Construction vehicle game - fork lift, front loader, excavator... Build, move and demolish!

Build your own vehicle - place and rotate: body, wheels, cranes, brake lights... Specify joints, engines (engine powers?, speeds?). First object is suspended in mid-air, but attached objects become "live" immediately when dragged to the scene. Test drive when done!

Physical programming game - give instructions such as "push left 10" and "pop". Try to hit something? Use car, hovercraft, spaceship...

Robo Arm - optimize a movement scheme to make the robot pick something up and move it to a designated area. Definition of done = object colliding with trigger and object velocity <= threshold.

Space ship flight. Fly though predefined map, steer using swipe left/right/up/down? Or accelerometer? Fly close to ground, to give impression of moving VERY fast.

MMO space flight. Looks a bit like Terminal Velocity. Ships parks in "bee hives", LoD the whole world. Fly, shoot. Guild vs. guild.

Gothenburg game - could be stopping foreign power invasion, alien space invasion, crime fighting/SWAT, on a massive scale with real maps! Premiere on a large theatre!

Single player vehicle simulation puzzle. Sorta like light-Bot, but in more dimentsions and with vehicles. The steering is a chart with different input (at interval times) and a slider next to each which determins "how much". Also add a road sign selector at the top of the chart (iPhone-like slider left/right?) where you can pick your vechile. Start/stop button. Done!

Playing a Matrix-style octopus! Flying quickly, swirling arms, landing hard, climbing and flying away again.

Playing a presentation. Don't know how or why, but I'm on to something.

Create an Early Warning System utilizing The Random Generator EGGS!

A game in which a server is also a client listening to other servers, and where the information on the game spreads throughout the nodes... Perhaps area based? Algo might also use a way to spread IRL geographical coordinates as world server coordinates.

Soap bubble game? Produce and catch 'em all.

Something inflatable... For instance spheres... Mm... something!

Car Jumpin'

Make a game with speech controls, for instance using http://www.politepix.com/openears/.

(Mind map web app - i.e. not a game - med googleapis/jQuery. Bygg ett dynamiskt träd där orden pekar ut sina föräldrar och antal kopplingar... Layouta svajande. Börja med en textinmatningsruta som omvandlas till rotnod.)

Pen Friend Thingie - pick language, interest, add photo, find friend, make automatic translations. Great idea!
