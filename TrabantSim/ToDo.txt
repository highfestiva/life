+Smaller ball in breakout.
+Cam follow target.
+Make orientation test "game": diamond-centered, cube-centered, physmesh-centered *asymmetric 3D* shapes.
+Asteroids. Fix Orientation with big O. Every friggin' game.
+Fog. terminal_velocity.py
-Smooth camera rotation. geometry_test.py
+Shadows do not work at all. physics.py
-Light shadow should be less from above and a little more from the side. breakout.py
+Tap screen to world translation doesn't work properly. Off by some. space_invaders.py
+Collisions.
+tetris.py
+Relative accelerometer. terminal_velocity.py
+Joysticks.

Make taps stick until polled. flappy_ufo.py, snake.py, tetris.py
Fix fog.
Tap/slide velocity.
Fix engine sounds.
Car.
Scaled texture+UVs on cubes. Implement checker material.
Heli.
Fix joystick setting: sloppy. When released outside of joystick it works, but when tap released inside it resets.
Reduce code mass. Cam setting on each game? Etc.
Optimize ASCII to object loading times. Pacman level must load in 0.1 seconds.
Chosts that hunt ball in Pac-Man!

Capsules.
City!
Quake.
Descent. Relative accelerometer for pitch.
Rolling ball, avoiding holes. Using accelerometer.
Tower defence game.
