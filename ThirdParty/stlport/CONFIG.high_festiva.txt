Mac PowerPC G5:
    Edit build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak and change the M_ARCH := line to ppc7400.
    Run
        ./configure --with-extra-ldflags="-L/usr/lib -lgcc /usr/lib/bundle1.o -undefined dynamic_lookup"


Mac x86_64:
    (DON'T Edit build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak and change the M_ARCH := line to x86_64.)
    Instead keep fingers crossed.
