Mac PowerPC G5:
    Edit build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak and change the M_ARCH := line to ppc7400.
    Run
	./configure --with-extra-ldflags="-undefined dynamic_lookup /usr/lib/dylib1.o"

Mac x86_64:
    (DON'T Edit build/Makefiles/gmake/sysid.mak and change the M_ARCH := line to x86_64.)
    Instead keep fingers crossed.

Windows:
    <cmd.exe> (can't run in msys)
    configure.bat msvc9
    cd build/lib
    nmake install
