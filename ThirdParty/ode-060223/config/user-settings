# ODE user settings: the following variables must be set by the user

# (1) the platform to use. this name should have a corresponding
#     makefile.PLATFORM file. currently supported platforms are:
#       msvc		microsoft visual C/C++
#       msvc-dll	microsoft visual C/C++, create a DLL
#       mingw		minimalist GNU for windows
#       cygwin		cygnus GNU for windows
#       unix-gcc	GNU gcc on unix
#       unix-generic	generic unix compiler. you may need to edit the CC
#			variable in makefile.unix-generic
#	osx		Mac OS-X, with the gnu compiler.

PLATFORM=unix-gcc

# (2) the floating point precision to use (either "SINGLE" or "DOUBLE")

#PRECISION=SINGLE
PRECISION=DOUBLE

# (3) the library type to build (either "debug" if you are doing development,
#     or "release" for the optimized library)

#BUILD=debug
BUILD=release

# (4) if you are using an old version of MS-Windows that has command line
#     length limitations then you will need to set this to "1". otherwise,
#     leave it at "0".

WINDOWS16=0

# (5) If you want to use the TriList (triangle mesh) geometry class, you must
#     have the OPCODE library installed somewhere. If this is the case then
#     uncomment the following variable and set it to point to the directory
#     where OPCODE is installed (note that you must have already compiled
#     OPCODE, ODE's build system will not do that for you).
#     See http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm for more information about
#     OPCODE. A recent version of OPCODE is provided in the ODE distribution
#     in the OPCODE subdirectory. This code was originally written for and
#     compiled on windows, but it has been ported so that it should compile
#     under unix/gcc too. Your mileage may vary.

#OPCODE_DIRECTORY=OPCODE
