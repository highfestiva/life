. Port server to Linux.
. Check multiplayer on two computers and one iPhone.
. Test which of Arena or Adventure play is best. Make a real map!
. Particles, explosions. Fire and white-hot sparks (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE); smoke and shrapnel (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA). Use grayscale texture with GL shading. Set a light on the explosion. Orient all billboards in one direction, not simply towards the camera. (http://www.idevgames.com/forums/thread-5399.html)
. Not possible to log in when someone is moving/shooting.
. Simple path finding.
. AI (where is the user probably going to appear after disappearing behind a building).
. Goal seeking missiles.
. Dynamic levels.
. Orient spawn engines correctly (for instance mines).
. Spawn engines for players, not hard-coded positions.
. Fix cam moves behind walls (like in Kill Cutie: cam moves up).
. UX design/menus.
. Money in the game.
. Get weapons, shield, health and ammo in "stores" in the game. (Triggers which add up your inventory after some time or at regular intervals.)
. One defence turret per team.
. Nice looks.
. Improve sound quality (doppler on grenades especially).
