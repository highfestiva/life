Game
---------
+ Random damage.
+ NPC:s.
+ Team play.
+ Tab score
+ Two computers.
+ The vehicle "jumps" when receiving an old server position from an explosion.
+ Server sometimes skips network positioning when a client just logged in.
+ Explode vehicle when health <= 0.
- Creating temporary, local missiles, which are taken over by the server later on (including extrapolation).
+ Make sure shooting oneself can't happen (using extrapolation? On server or client?).
+ Ramps, bridges, elevators, doors.
+ Destructable obstacles.
+ Implement machine gun.
+ Mouse look
+ Port server to Linux.
+ Particles, explosions. Fire and white-hot sparks (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE); smoke and shrapnel (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA). Use grayscale texture with GL shading. Set a light on the explosion. Orient all billboards in one direction, not simply towards the camera. (http://www.idevgames.com/forums/thread-5399.html)
+ Check multiplayer on two computers and one iPhone.
+ Drop the old particle systems! Or make them use the new one!
+ Fix the bomber planes showing up after dropping payload in out of process server.
+ Fix crash bug in networking code destruction (always crashes on client when destructing, but never when not).
+ Fix objects blinking by in origo first frame after load (out-of-process server).
+ Object should start spinning when hit by a grenade/in an explosion.
. Disconnect should happen when you suspend, cancellable connect should happen when you resume.
. Improve mouselook on PC.
. Mouselook should work on Mac.
. Orient spawn engines correctly (for instance mines).
. Not possible to log in when someone is moving/shooting.
. Spawn engines for players, not hard-coded positions.
. Refactor (code -> Life?) and split Push and HoverTank.
. Test which of Arena or Adventure play is best. Make a real map!
. Simple path finding.
. AI (where is the user probably going to appear after disappearing behind a building).
. Homing missiles.
. Add lobbing missiles/homing grenades, which travel to high altitude and can be used to take out bomb planes!
. Dynamic, moving objects in levels.
. Fix cam moves behind walls (like in Kill Cutie: cam moves up).
. UX design/menus.
. Money in the game.
. Get weapons, shield, health and ammo in "stores" in the game. (Triggers which add up your inventory after some time or at regular intervals.)
. One defence turret per team.
. Nice tank looks -- env mapping on vehicles?
. Make level look nice. Lighted textures? Light maps? Env maps?
. Improve sound quality (doppler on grenades especially).


Engine
----------
. GLES2?
. iPhone 3GS performance.
. Beautify rendering.
