ProgWar = Programmer Wars! Make the best AI tank you can and win over your colleagues.

Run server.py to start a local server. Run "ai.py knasen_client.ini" to start a local client with those credentials.

The AI client logs into the server and the game begins when at least two have joined.

 - Each AI client gets three tanks.
 - Only tanks and cannon balls exist in the game. Both can be seen as radar blips.
 - The positions of all other objects are updated once per second to resemble radar and to give the programmers some work.
 - The positions of one's own tanks are updated 5 times per second.
 - You can fire the cannon shot every 5 seconds.
 - The playfield is a flat square floor 240x240 meters.
 - The cannon ball is fired at 30 meters per second at any angle you desire.
 - Cheating is encouraged.
